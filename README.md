# FIFA World Cup (1930 - 2018) Exploratory Data Analysis

## Context
I have been trying to work on my Data Analytics skills for the past few months in theory. This is the first time I have applied in a practical manner. I used the 
[FIFA World Cup Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset) for this project.

## Prerequisites
The project uses three libraries which is pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn.
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

## Questions asked during the project
1. Which team has won the most World Cups?
2. Does being host give a better chance of a World Cup Win?
3. How many unique teams have joined the World Cup?
4. Which team has the most World Cup appearances? Which ones have the least?
5. How has goalscoring improved throughout the years?
6. How many goals do championship teams usually score and concede?
